		<h1><b>ABOUT ME</b></h1>
			<p>I'm a generally happy person born and raised in Far Rockaway, Queens. I love the ocean and the beach, in part because I had grown up knowing it was only five minutes away from home. I enjoy helping others a lot, and volunteer whenever I can. I'm a die hard fan of physics, as it's basically the explanation to everything in the universe(Well, almost (Higgs Boson FTW)). In general, I'm a very postivie person that tries to go with the flow no matter what he situation. Life is like surfing; if you relax and ride the waves, everything will be okay.</p>
