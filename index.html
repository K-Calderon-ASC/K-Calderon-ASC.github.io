            <img src="gen-z.png" height="500px">
            <p>A website that caters towards GEN Z: current high school and college aged people, and gives them a space to share their opinions on curren events, politics, fashion, art, etc. It's a place where they can voice their opinions, no matter what it may be. This was my final project for All Star Code during the summer of 2016.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a current high school senior living in NYC, who enjoys strolling through art museums and iced black coffee (yes, even in the winter). I will be attending Stanford University this fall.</p>
            <p>I'm a creator at heart, and I love anything and everything that has to do with creation, from art to film to fashion, and most especially coding and the tech industry. I have a deep passion for media and communications, and how we use technology to innovate those connections.</p>
            <p>I may be young, but I do enjoy a challenge, and always find a way to get the job done ;)</p>

            <h2>Academia</h2>
            <p>I will be attending Stanford University this fall (Class of 2022). Let's go Cardinal!</p>
            <p>I am a current high school senior in Queens with a GPA of 101.38</p>
            <p>Over the summer of 2017, I did an online research program called Pioneer Academics. I studied under Professor Miriam Rossi of Vassar College, and published a paper that used data attained x-ray crystallography to find the connection between molecular structures of insecticides and their interactions with the protein receptors in insects.
